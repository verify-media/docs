# Organization Nodes

## Ids

As org nodes don't point to digital assets directly, their ids are not calculated based on the content they represent. Org Ids must be unique, one option for
doing so is computing them like the following:

```
newOrgNodeId = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(user),nonce + 1));
```

## Authorization

Authorization modules for both reference and access are set utilizing the `setAccessAuth()` and `setReferenceAuth()` methods.
Providing auth to a user at the org level means that all users authorized here will have access/reference on all child content nodes.

## Metadata

Each org node is associated with optional metadata which helps an indexing user understand the content of its children.

The data field is flexible for organizations to declare the necessary information to consume the underlying content.

In future standards may be developed for organizational patterns.

## Metadata Schema


### Fields

* `data` contains all the optional associated metadata for an org node.
* `signature` contains the signature param/values from signing the content in the data field

#### data

* `data.description` a textual description of the children of the org node
* `data.manifest` a extendable field where additional metadata can be stored and attested to by the signer

#### signature

* `signature.curve` the elliptic curve used to sign the content of the data field
* `signature.signature` the produced signature from signing the message
* `signature.digest` the keccak256 hash of the content in the data field
* `signature.description` a textual description of the method used to generate the signature

### Example Org Node Schema

```json
{
  "data": {
    "description": "",
    "manifest": {},
  },
   "signature": {
    "curve": "",
    "signature": "",
    "message": "",
    "description": "",
  },
}
```
